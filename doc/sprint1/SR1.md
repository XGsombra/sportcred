### All tasks for this sprint are finished

### Practices that we should continue:
* Use FormData to transfer files, and use json to transfer other string format data
* Adapted minimalist design style, which is beautiful
Use Flutter builtin image widgets to simplify image transfer logic
* Use an individual image server and the api server sends the image url in json.

### Some new practices that we might want to use:
* Use shared_preferences to store 

### Harmful practices we should stop using (if any):
* Using FormData to transfer both file and json
* Put data in the GET request body.

### Our best/worst experience during sprint 1:
* Make beautiful UI (really great minimalist design)
figured out how to transmit files (multiple) through REST API.
* Spent days figuring out how stateful widget in flutter works, and why they are used.
