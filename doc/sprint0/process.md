* Our team schedules meetings on WeChat, usually scheduled at 9:30 pm, and holds meetings on Discord, each time about 2 hours, almost everyday since 8 days before the deadline. Everyone is present in the meetings and we communicate in audio.
* Roles: Quanhong Liu is our group leader, responsible for tracking processes and holding meetings. Keping Le is responsible for making the mock-up User Interface. Wentao Jiang, Quanhong Liu, and Xuduo Gu summarized the result of discussions and wrote the files. Ziheng Zhuang and Jiasheng Ye researched and tested the programming language and frameworks we are going to use.
* Wentao Jiang creates Google Docs for each document and shares them to the resources section of Discord, and then we collaborate on writing them during the meetings.
* The team member working on User Interface mock-up shares screen on Discord during the meetings and we give advice on it.
* We make decisions by listing possible solutions and then vote on them to come up with the final decision.
* We decide the story points by using an online scrum poker application. After a round of showing all team members' estimated points, the members with the highest or lowest point explain their reason for giving such a high or low point, and then we have another round of point selection until at least 4 members agree on a point, and that would be our story point. We take 1.73 rounds of voting in average.
* We define the priority of stories by considering several aspects:

  a. Whether this feature is needed by, or depending on many other future features. 

  b. Whether this feature is emphasized by product owners. 

  c. Possible schedules of which stories assigned to each sprint considering their story points.
* Additionally, we divided our team to two groups: 3 in front-end and 3 in back-end, communicating using rest api.
* Lessons we should take forward to the next sprint: 

  a. When we encounter questions or confusions on the requirements, we should ask the product owner or instructor about them rather than discuss them by ourselves which is kind of wasting time.
  
  b. When facing selection between development tools, we should try them by ourselves rather than only seeking information online.
