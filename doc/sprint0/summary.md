## Project Objectives:

- Create a user friendly and easy-to-reach mobile platform for amateur and professional basketball fans to communicate with others with the same interests and gain credits for their own insights. 
- Create a credible online basketball community with a multi-tier score-driven system which stimulates users to use this application frequently and relatively professionally than in other communities.

## Key users
Basketball fans who
- carry unique opinions about basketball and seek for resonance.
- have their favorite basketball teams and seek for a community.
- want to learn or share knowledge about basketball.
- want to kill time by browsing news and analyses about basketball.

## Key use cases

- Potentially becoming a new form of social media for basketball fans specifically.
- Can be used as an interactive online mini game platform for ethusist.
- As an evaluator of how deep the basketball fans’ understanding of basketball are.
- Making new basketball fans to gain more interest and settling in the basketball community by gaining confidence through our platform.


## Key usage scenarios
- Yelena is a basketball fan, but there aren’t anyone with the same interest around her. This mobile application makes casual sport chat with other basketball fans after dinner actually tangible for her.
- Tony lost interest in following and commenting on sports news on other platforms, but with SPORTCRED, when he gets high ACS credits, he also gets tons of likes for his analysis and knowledge, making him confident again and staying enthusiastic.
- Lucas is an NBA fan who watches every NBA game, but he cannot find anything to do during halftime. With this application, he can play interactive online mini games which make him happy all the time.

## Principles
- ACS driven harmonious community - The app applies appropriate algorithms for the ACS system to penalize offensive behaviors in the community
- User friendly - The design should provide a great user experience so that users of all groups of age can easily use this app
