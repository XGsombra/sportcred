* vs Twitter  
Admittedly Twitter is a popular app for discussion with its large network of users. However, with more users, Twitter also has the problem of "unrational users", who impolitely attack other users without a good point of view. In SportCred, we create an atmosphere of relatively rational and professional debate by using a multi-tier score-driven system.
* vs www.nba.com  
Unlike our product, users can't comment on the news on nba.com. Our product provides an opportunity for basketball fans to express their ideas freely on NBA news through our Open Court and Analyze sections.
* vs Instagram  
Instagram is an app that is designed for the sharing of beautiful pictures and videos, and that is the reason why the most important part of each post are the pictures or the videos. In Instagram posts, the comment area for each post is folded, which means users are not likely to check what other people think. However, in SportCred, users are provided with more collision of ideas and critical thinking, which is not emphasized by Instagram.
